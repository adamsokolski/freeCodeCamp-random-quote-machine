# random-quote-machine

As a part of Front End Development Libraries Projects, I'm building app, that render random quotes.
Below I will list problems, that I encountered.

## Issue 1 - Quote is to long to tweet.

So I can call API for another one, but I think it would be better to simply disable tweet button if quote is too long. I want to use every quote, not only short ones.
